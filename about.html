        <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase my technical skills. I made this site from scratch, pure coding. In 2022 I traveled through Brazil and did voluntary work, in order for me to get out of my 'bulb' and explore the world. Currently, I am studying Creative Technology in Lisbon. I work with a broad range of software. Including software to edit videos, make animations, create games, mix music and design logos. I am very creative and I will showcase this through my work. If you want to work with me or get in contact for collaborations or questions feel free to do so. I see every challenge as a lesson.</p>
